Try different deep learning time series architectures

## Plan

For each model build a pipeline for:

1. Just predicting 100 days ahead for the S&P 500 Index 
    - develop graphing functions
    - create test/val/predict 



## Nomenclature




# Preprocessing

## Scaling

Sometimes values in the data are very large or otherwise far away from the initial parameter values. Using a MinMaxScaler from sk-learn can get the values closer to zero. A small pain converting values back to their original values but definitely worthwhile.
